This folder will contain R (or python) scripts for performing unsupervised learning on a 
screen sized data set.

The screen data is stored in $SCRATCH/screenData, and is drawn from the following 
location on bc:
/home/morphology/Morphology/Images/Screens_Rad52/1_Primary_Screens/1and2_SM_and_SMPhleo/RAD52GH_HTA2mCN_can1RPL39prtdTU_Rep1/Batches/Batch2_2011_05_11_Phleo0h_ProducingTiffsForNuclearMorphology_IPA_0p002_20Smooth20Suppress_15and40

Eventually I will make this into a git repository, so that I can work on the code from 
elsewhere.  

A todo list of the project so far:

[Early work]
 
1) Transfer data (done)
2) Transfer labels for the data as generated by the SVM foci classifier (ongoing)
3) Find or make R packages to do PCA on a whole screen's volume of data (done, scikits-learn)
4) Find of make R packages to do k-means out of core on scinet (done, scikits-learn will do this)

[Middling work]

5) Figure best way to dump screen data in smaller files into one hdf5 file for better optimization on scinet's filesystem.

7) Evaluate performance of PCA on the screen data set.
	- Look at the decay in the eigenvalue spectrum
	- Does K-means clustering produce meaningful results on the data set when k is 
approximately equal to the number of significant eigenvalues?

8) Evaluate performance of K-means clustering on the data
	- Does K-means clustering produce meaningful results on the data set for any 
values of k?
	- Does a non-linear feature transformation of the data, followed by out-of-core 
K-means with euclidean distance yield better results for the same data set?

[Later work]

Depending on the results of 1-8, this will make the case for pursuing a more advanced 
model.  There are several possibilities:
