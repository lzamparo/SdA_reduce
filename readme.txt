This project is an unsupervised algorithm for characterizing cell populations in high content screening experiments.  The project is a pipeline in two parts.  The first part performs dimensionality reduction by SdA (Stacked de-noising Autoencoder).  The second part fits a DP mixture model to a randomly sampled subset of the data.  

The screen data is stored in $SCRATCH/sm_rep1_data, and is drawn from the following
